# summarize

!!! info "Offload (LLM) — lossy, reversible"
    Compresses the middle of the trajectory into one LLM-written summary; the replaced span is stashed under a marker.

## How it works

`summarize` compresses the **middle of the trajectory** into one LLM-written summary (ported from
CE-Manager's ReSum-style summarizer). It restructures the message list to
`[msg0, <summary system message>, last-K]`; the replaced span is stashed under a marker carried in
the summary message, so `expand` restores the full earlier trajectory. This is the one component
that changes the message count — `apply.Body` rebuilds the body keeping the retained messages
byte-identical.

The summarizer is grounded in the **current task** (first user turn + recent turns are passed as
"summarize toward this"), not a blind digest of the middle.

`summarize` calls a model chosen by `model.source`: `incoming` (default — reuse the proxied
request's own model + key) or `config` (a dedicated cheap model set via `CHEAP_MODEL*` env / the
gateway's `CheapModel`). When no model is available it degrades to a no-op.

**Gating + reuse:** a `trigger` (`min_request_tokens`, `min_messages`; legacy `start_from_message`
folds into `min_messages`) gates the first summary so it fires only on a large/deep transcript.
After that, the summary is **checkpointed per session** and **reused verbatim** (no model call, and
byte-identical so the prefix stays KV-cache stable) until the un-summarized tail grows past
`resummarize_tokens`, when the checkpoint rolls forward with a fresh summary. This is what stops it
re-summarizing every turn.

Run it **alone** (its own preset) — it restructures the whole transcript.

## Before → After

```
before:  [system, u1, tool, a1, tool, u2, … 30 turns …, uN-1, uN]
after:   [system, "=== History Summary === … <summary> … <<cg:…>>", uN-1, uN]
```

## Lossiness

Lossy but reversible — the replaced span is stashed under the summary message's marker and
recovered via `context_guru_expand` / `GET /expand`.

## Configuration

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `summary_level` | `regular` | `concise` \| `regular` \| `highly_detailed`. |
| `keep_last` | 3 | Trailing messages kept verbatim. |
| `min_tokens` | 500 | Span floor — minimum middle size before summarizing. |
| `include_tool_calls` | `false` | `false` → tool outputs masked in the summarized trajectory. |
| `resummarize_tokens` | 6000 | Tail growth that triggers rolling the checkpoint forward. |
| `start_from_message` | 6 | Legacy message-count gate, folded into `trigger.min_messages` when that is unset. Prefer `trigger.min_messages`; this key is still read so old documents keep working. |
| `model.source` | `incoming` | LLM source: `incoming` (proxied model+key) or `config` (cheap model). |
| `model.model` | *the source's own model* | The model to summarize WITH, on that source's endpoint and credential. |
| `model.provider` | `anthropic` | Wire dialect for a config-pinned endpoint: `anthropic` \| `openai`. |
| `model.base_url` | *the provider's public API* | Pin a dedicated endpoint as a full URL. |
| `model.api_key` | *the process env key* | **Credential** for the pinned endpoint; empty falls back to the provider env key, which a hosted deployment refuses. Write-only on the settings page. |
| `model.auth` | `x-api-key` | Anthropic only: `x-api-key` \| `bearer`. |
| `trigger` | — | Gates the first summary: `min_request_tokens`, `min_messages`, `min_output_tokens`, and the window fractions `min_request_frac`, `min_output_frac`, `huge_output_frac`. |
| `marker_mode` | `full` | `full` (stash + resolvable marker) / `summary` / `off`. |

## When it shines

Long agentic sessions where the bulk is stale middle context.

## When it's inert

Transcript below `trigger`, span below `min_tokens`, or no model available (no-op).
