# Set up context-guru for Codex

First run `python3 ../../scripts/codex_plugin.py setup --plan` from this skill directory. It writes
nothing. Read and relay its `consent_question=` as one explicit yes/no question. A missing or
ambiguous answer is no.

Explain that setup adds a `context-guru` provider and profile to `$CODEX_HOME/config.toml` and
never changes the default provider, so plain `codex` keeps working even if the proxy is down.
Routed sessions start through the `launch=` launcher printed by the plan. The current session
cannot change transport. Name the standalone reset path printed by setup. Only after explicit consent, run
`python3 ../../scripts/codex_plugin.py setup --i-consent-to-traffic-interception` with
`sandbox_permissions="require_escalated"`, explaining that setup must write user configuration
and state, download a release when needed, start the local proxy, and verify loopback health. Do
not first run the mutating command in the sandbox: a denied write could leave a partial setup.

If the binary is missing, setup downloads the matching published release and verifies its SHA-256
checksum before installing it into plugin-owned state. On success, report the emitted `launch=`
command and tell the user to exit and start Codex with it. Routing starts in that next process; it
cannot change the transport of the current session.
